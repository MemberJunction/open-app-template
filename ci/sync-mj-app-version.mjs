/**
 * Syncs `mj-app.json`'s `version` and `mjVersionRange` from the packages.
 *
 * Runs as part of `version:prepare`, i.e. INSIDE the Version Packages PR. This used to happen
 * in publish.yml, but publish no longer writes anything back to the repo except the tag —
 * so if the manifest were not synced here it would never be synced at all, and every
 * release would ship an mj-app.json still claiming the previous version.
 *
 *   version         <- packages/Entities/package.json .version (all packages are fixed-versioned)
 *   mjVersionRange  <- the @memberjunction/core dependency, as ">=<min> <nextMajor>.0.0"
 *
 * The range derivation deliberately keeps any prerelease suffix: `^6.1.0-edge.3` yields
 * `>=6.1.0-edge.3 <7.0.0`, not `>=6.1.0 <7.0.0`. Both behave identically through MJ's host
 * gate — it coerces the host version to its base tuple before matching, so neither form can
 * distinguish edge.1 from edge.3 — but the suffixed form states the floor the app actually
 * needs (it imports MJCard* components that exist only in 6.1.0-edge.3), and that floor IS
 * hard-enforced in each package's npm ranges, which pnpm and npm evaluate without coercion.
 * A previous attempt to strip the suffix here is what pushed the manifest back to `>=6.1.0`;
 * the un-stripped derivation is the intended behaviour.
