# MJ Central runs on PostgreSQL and installs BizApps. App migrations are authored in T-SQL and
# run through the same Skyway engine MJ uses, which needs a converted Postgres file per
# migration. Without one, a release carrying a new migration ships something MJ Central cannot
# run — and nothing else in this pipeline notices.
#
# Naming follows MJ's own convention, which is the authority here:
#   migrations/V<stamp>__<name>.sql          T-SQL
#   migrations-pg/V<stamp>__<name>.pg.sql    its Postgres counterpart   (227 in MJ)
#   migrations-pg/V<stamp>__<name>.pg-only.sql   Postgres-only, no T-SQL side   (36 in MJ)
#
# Three one-sided spellings are in use and all three are accepted: `.pg-only.sql` (MJ's, 36
# files), `.pgonly.sql` (one file here) and, for completeness, anything else already shipped.
# They are not reconciled, because renaming a released migration is the very thing the
# immutability check forbids — Flyway checksums the file, so every database that already ran it
# would fail validation. The convention binds what we ADD, not what shipped.
#
# Only newly-added T-SQL migrations are held to the pairing rule, so one-sided files of any
# spelling are simply never examined.
#
# Two levels, set by PG_COUNTERPART_LEVEL:
#   warning  at the door (PRs into next): annotate the PR, never fail it. Authors may add the
#            converted file in a later PR before the release.
#   error    at the gate (the release PR into main, base = last v* tag): the default. A release
#            must not ship a migration MJ Central cannot run.
