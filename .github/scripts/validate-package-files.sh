#!/bin/bash
# Validates that every publishable workspace package restricts what it ships.
# Every package.json under packages/ is checked -- no scope or name filter, so a copied script checks
# whatever packages its repo has. `private: true` is the only exclusion.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. npm includes EVERYTHING not excluded when a package declares neither a
# `files` field nor an `.npmignore`. Contracts declared neither, and `pnpm publish -r --dry-run`
# packed 71 `src/`, `*.test.*` and `tsconfig` entries — the full TypeScript source, shipped to
# consumers alongside `dist`. Nothing fails: the publish succeeds and no consumer complains about
# receiving source it will never compile, so the only way to notice is to look. Hence a gate.
#
# It is also the family convention rather than a preference — bizapps-accounting (5/5),
# bizapps-common (5/5) and bizapps-tasks (6/6) all carry both fields on every package.
#
# Private packages are exempt and need neither field: `pnpm publish -r` and `changeset publish`
# both skip them (@changesets/cli: `packages.filter(pkg => !pkg.packageJson.private)`), so a
# private package's `files` has no bearing on what ships. Same predicate and rationale as
# validate-npm-packages.sh / validate-package-repository.sh, so all three gates agree on what
# "a package we publish" means. Skips are logged rather than silent so an accidental
# `"private": true` stays visible in CI output, and a jq failure yields an empty string — which is
# not "true", so the package still gets checked (the conservative direction).
